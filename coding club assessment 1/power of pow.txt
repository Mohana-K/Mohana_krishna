Given a single integer N, your task is to find the sum of the square of the first N even natural Numbers.
 

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 20
Explanation: 22 + 42 = 20

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10000

code:
class Solution:
    def sum_of_square_evenNumbers(self, n):
        # Code here
        sum=((2*n)*(n+1)*((2*n)+1))//3
        return sum
