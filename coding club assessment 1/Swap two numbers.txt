Swap given two numbers and print them. (Try to do it without a temporary variable.) and return it.

Example 1:

Input: a = 13, b = 9
Output: 9 13
Explanation: after swapping it
becomes 9 and 13.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ a, b ≤ 106


code:
class Solution:
    def get(self, a, b):
        #code here
        a=a-b
        b=a+b
        a=b-a
        return a,b
