1.Write a program to find the sum of the given series 1+2+3+ . . . . . .(N terms) 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: For n = 1, sum will be 1.
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 109

CODE:
class Solution {
  public:
    long long seriesSum(long long n) {
    long long sum;
    sum=n*(n+1)/2; //FORMULA FOR SUM OF THE N NATURAL NUMBERS
    return sum;
    }
};
