You are given an integer N, reverse the digits of given number N, ensuring that the reversed number has no leading zeroes. Return the resulting reversed number.

Example 1:

Input: 200
Output: 2
Explanation: By reversing the digts of 
number, number will change into 2.

Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1015





CODE:
class Solution
{
	public:
		long long int reverse_digit(long long int n)
		{
		    // Code here
		    long long int rev_n=0,r;
		    while(n>0){
		        r=n%10;
		        rev_n=rev_n*10+r;
		        n=n/10;
		    }
		    return rev_n;
		}
};
