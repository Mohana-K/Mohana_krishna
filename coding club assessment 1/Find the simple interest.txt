Given three integers P,R and T, denoting Principal, Rate of Interest and Time period respectively.Compute the simple Interest.

Example 1:

Input:
P=100
R=20
T=2
Output:
40.00
Explanation:
The simple interest on 100 at a rate
of 20% across 2 time periods is 40.

Expected Time Complexity:O(1)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)
 

Constraints:
1<=P<=105
1<=R,T<=100

code:
#User function Template for python3
class Solution:
    def simpleInterest(self,A,B,C):
        #code here
        return ((A*B*C)/100)
