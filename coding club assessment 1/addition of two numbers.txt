Given two numbers A and B. Your task is to return the sum of A and B.

 

Example 1:

Input:
A = 1, B = 2
Output:
3
Explanation:
Addition of 1 and 2 is 3.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= A, B <= 1018

code:
class Solution{   
public:
    int addition(int A, int B){
        // code here
        int sum;
        sum=A+B;
        return sum;
    }
};
