Given a number N, find the Nth term in the series 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21â€¦

 

Example 1:

Input :
N = 4 
Output:
10
Explanation:
The 4th term of the Series is 10.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 104

code:
class Solution {
  public:
    int findNthTerm(int N) {
        // code here
        int a=1,i;
        for(i=1;i<N;i++){
            a=a+(i+1);
        }
        return a;
    }
};
