For a given 3 digit number, find whether it is armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number of three digits is a number such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. Return "Yes" if it is a armstrong number else return "No".
NOTE: 371 is an Armstrong number since 33 + 73 + 13 = 371
