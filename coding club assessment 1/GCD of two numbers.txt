Given two positive integers a and b, find GCD of a and b.

Note: Don't use the inbuilt gcd function

Example 1:

Input: 
a = 3
b = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: GCD of 3 and 6 is 3

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(min(a, b)))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ a, b ≤ 109

code:

class Solution {
  public:
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        // code here
        int temp;
        while (a!=0 && b!=0)
        {
            temp=a;
            a=b;
            b=temp%a;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
